# Commit and release workflow

This is the canonical checklist for `Shirowwww/Achievement-Watcher-Next`. Other
project documents link here instead of duplicating the release process.

## Commit rules

1. Start with `git status --short --branch` and preserve unrelated changes.
2. Split work by concern. Code, tests and the matching `CHANGELOG.md` entry may
   stay together; unrelated docs, dependency refreshes and CI fixes get separate
   commits.
3. Stage explicit paths, inspect `git diff --cached`, then commit.
4. Use short English Conventional Commit subjects, for example:
   - `fix: sync dependency lockfile`
   - `feat: add controller UI navigation`
   - `docs: clarify notification setup`
   - `chore: update runtime and dependencies`
5. Do not add generated-by or unrelated co-authoring attribution to commits or
   public-facing text.
6. Never rewrite already-pushed history unless the user explicitly requests it.

## Release preparation

Use a new SemVer version. A published version is immutable: never replace its
installer to force an update, because clients only update to a higher version.

Update the same version in all of these places:

- `app/package.json`
- `app/package-lock.json` (root package entries)
- `watchdog/package.json`
- `watchdog/package-lock.json` (root package entries)
- `CHANGELOG.md`: move relevant `Unreleased` entries under the dated version
- `RELEASE_NOTES.md`: title, highlights and installer filename

The README release badge is dynamic and does not require a manual version edit.
Do not hand-edit generated `app/dist/latest.yml`; the build creates it.

## Documentation accuracy check

Do this for every release, not only ones that "feel" doc-worthy - stale docs accumulate silently
between releases otherwise:

- **`README.md` "What it does" list**: add a phrase for any genuinely new capability this release
  ships (a new source, a new tool, a reliability/data-safety change). Bug fixes belong in
  `CHANGELOG.md`, not this list. If nothing list-worthy shipped, leave it alone.
- **`docs/comparison.md`**: only touch a row if this release changed the behavior it describes. Do
  not re-verify the whole table on every release - that is a separate, occasional audit (see below),
  not a per-release step.
- **Stale absolute paths**: if this release changed a user-data path, filename or directory (the
  3.5.3 `%APPDATA%\Achievement Watcher 3.0` split from the legacy `%APPDATA%\Achievement Watcher`
  is the precedent), grep the whole repo for the old form - public docs, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`,
  and the local `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` notes all drift independently and have shipped stale paths
  before.
- **Broken doc links**: confirm every `[text](path#anchor)` added or touched this release actually
  resolves (a moved/renamed file or a renamed heading breaks the anchor silently). A quick script
  that resolves every relative link in every tracked `.md` file against the filesystem is cheap
  insurance - see git history around 2026-08-05 for one.

### Occasional: re-verifying the comparison table against competing projects

Do this only when asked, or when a competing project's fork clearly changed - not every release.
When you do it: **check the competitor's actual source (`main.js`/`preload.js`/renderer HTML,
fetched via `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/contents/<path> -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.raw"`),
not just their README.** A README is a marketing summary and routinely under-describes real
features. A missing README mention is not evidence of a missing feature - grep the code before
downgrading a ✅ to a ❌.

## Clean validation

From the repository root in PowerShell:

```powershell
git diff --check

Push-Location app
npm ci
npm test
npm audit --omit=dev
Pop-Location

Push-Location watchdog
npm ci
npm test
npm audit --omit=dev
Pop-Location
```

The app suite includes locale completeness. If a native optional dependency is
unavailable on the current machine, record the exact limitation; do not silently
skip a failed check.

Before release, confirm the four package and lockfile root versions match:

```powershell
node -e "for (const p of ['app/package.json','app/package-lock.json','watchdog/package.json','watchdog/package-lock.json']) console.log(p, require('./' + p).version)"
```

## Build and artifact checks

Build on Windows from `app/`:

```powershell
Push-Location app
npm run build
Pop-Location
```

Expected files:

- `app/dist/Achievement.Watcher.Setup.<version>.exe`
- `app/dist/Achievement.Watcher.Setup.<version>.exe.blockmap`
- `app/dist/latest.yml`

Check that `latest.yml` names the exact installer and version. Verify its SHA-512
against the built installer:

```powershell
$version = (Get-Content app/package.json | ConvertFrom-Json).version
$installer = "app/dist/Achievement.Watcher.Setup.$version.exe"
$expected = [Convert]::ToBase64String(
  [Security.Cryptography.SHA512]::HashData([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes($installer))
)
Get-Content app/dist/latest.yml
$expected
```

Also smoke-test the packaged runtime and the affected feature path. For runtime
inspection, temporarily use Electron as Node and always remove the variable:

```powershell
$env:ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE = '1'
& 'app/dist/win-unpacked/Achievement Watcher.exe' -e "console.log(process.versions)"
Remove-Item Env:ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE
```

The build runs `npm prune --omit=dev` in `watchdog/`. Restore its development
dependencies afterward with `npm install` from `watchdog/`.

## Push, CI and GitHub release

1. Ensure commits are atomic and the worktree contains no accidental files.
2. Push `main` to `origin` and wait for `.github/workflows/test.yml` to pass.
3. Create the GitHub release only after CI succeeds, uploading all three updater
   assets:

```powershell
$version = (Get-Content app/package.json | ConvertFrom-Json).version
$target = git rev-parse HEAD
gh release create "v$version" `
  "app/dist/Achievement.Watcher.Setup.$version.exe" `
  "app/dist/Achievement.Watcher.Setup.$version.exe.blockmap" `
  "app/dist/latest.yml" `
  --repo Shirowwww/Achievement-Watcher-Next `
  --target $target `
  --title "Achievement Watcher Next $version" `
  --notes-file RELEASE_NOTES.md
```

4. Verify the release page exposes the installer, blockmap and `latest.yml`, and
   that the public manifest is downloadable.
5. Refresh the version the website prints under its download buttons, and commit it:

```powershell
node tools/site/release-data.js
git add docs/data/release.json
git commit -m "docs: publish <version> on the site"
```

   The file is read from the site's own origin rather than from the GitHub API, so a visitor never
   spends an unauthenticated rate limit to see a version number. Missing or stale, the pages fall
   back to their own wording; they never show a wrong version.

## Identifiers that must not change

The product was renamed to Achievement Watcher Next in 3.9.0, but several identifiers deliberately
kept their historical value because an existing install is keyed on them. Changing any of these
breaks upgrades rather than merely renaming something, and `test/core/branding.test.js` pins them:

| Identifier | Value | Why it stays |
|---|---|---|
| `appId` (AppUserModelID) | `io.github.shirowwww.achievement.watcher` | Windows matches toasts and taskbar pins against it |
| `executableName` | `Achievement Watcher` | Fixes the .exe name, install directory and uninstaller filename; the autostart registry value stores that full path, and the Watchdog spawns the app by it |
| `app.setName()` | `Achievement Watcher` | Names the autostart registry value and the main log file |
| Installer artifact | `Achievement.Watcher.Setup.<version>.exe` | Referenced by `latest.yml`; published releases are immutable |
| `updaterCacheDirName` | `achievement-watcher-updater` | Existing partially downloaded updates live there |
| Legacy data folders | `Achievement Watcher 3.0`, `Achievement Watcher` | Import sources for the one-way migration; never renamed or deleted |

### The repository rename

The repository was renamed `Achievement-Watcher-3.0` → `Achievement-Watcher-Next` for 3.9.0. Clients
released before 3.9.0 shipped an `app-update.yml` naming the **old** repository, so they reach new
releases only through GitHub's permanent rename redirect. That redirect was verified end to end
against electron-updater's own HTTP stack - the `releases.atom` feed, the `latest.yml` channel file
and the installer asset all follow the 301 transparently.

**Never create a new repository at `Shirowwww/Achievement-Watcher-3.0`.** Doing so takes over the old
path, kills the redirect and permanently strands every client older than 3.9.0. Releases must also
stay on this repository: moving them to a different owner or repo breaks the same path.

## Auto-update proof

An updater check is only meaningful from an installed lower version to the newly
published higher version.

1. Keep the previous stable installer available and install/run that version.
2. Publish the new higher version and its matching `latest.yml`, installer and
   blockmap.
3. Launch the previous installed version normally (not `npm start`).
4. Confirm logs show the GitHub feed check, the new version download and the
   restart prompt.
5. Accept restart, then confirm the running app reports the new version.

Do not claim auto-update success from source mode, an unpacked build, or a
same-version asset replacement.

### Validation log

- **3.5.2 (2026-08-04):** maintainer confirmed the installed-app auto-update
  from 3.5.1 to 3.5.2 (feed check, download, restart prompt and reported
  version).

## Final handoff

- Confirm `git status --short --branch` is clean and synchronized.
- Report tests, build output, CI result, release URL and updater result separately.
- If the user asked to relaunch the application, relaunch the installed build only
  after validation is complete.
