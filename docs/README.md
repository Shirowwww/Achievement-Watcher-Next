| # | Guide | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | [Getting started](getting-started.md) | Install, first run, Simple vs Advanced, finding games, updates |
| 2 | [Compatible sources](sources.md) | Every source AW Next can read, and what each one needs |
| 3 | [Notifications](notifications.md) | Delivery modes, Automatic, sounds, position, screenshot souvenirs |
| 4 | [Presets and the Preset Designer](presets.md) | The look of the popup, designing your own, sharing `.awpreset` files |
| 5 | [Overlay](overlay.md) | The in-game achievement list: search, filters, rarity, customization |
| 6 | [Controller](controller.md) | Drive the app and the overlay with a gamepad |
| 7 | [Game Health](game-health.md) | The per-game report and its guided repairs |
| 8 | [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) | Discovery, progress, notification and playtime problems |

## When you need it

| Guide | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [FAQ](faq.md) | Short answers to the questions that come up most |
| [Advanced tools](advanced.md) | Maintenance, cache clearing, resets, manual games, diagnostics |
| [Goldberg / GBE setup](emulator-setup.md) | Diagnose or repair an emulated Steam game |
| [Uplay R2 setup](uplay-r2.md) | The Ubisoft equivalent, for compatible titles |
| [Comparison](comparison.md) | How AW Next differs from Achievement Watcher 2.x and Achievements |
| [Preset gallery](preset-gallery.md) | The community gallery: installing a preset from it, and submitting yours |
| [Gallery server](gallery-server.md) | For a maintainer: running the service that takes submissions directly |
| [Localization](localization.md) | The 28 bundled languages, what is deliberately not translated, and why this site is English |

The in-app **Settings → Help** tab is the quickest reference while you are using the app. It reflects
your actual configuration - overlay hotkey, controller layout and bindings, notification mode, theme,
enabled sources - and filters its topic cards as you type.
