# FAQ

Short answers to the questions that come up most. Each one links to the guide that covers it
properly.

## Getting set up

**Do I need a Steam Web API key, or to sign in to Steam?**
No. Achievement lists are fetched with a keyless chain of public endpoints, and nothing requires an
account. For your *own* Steam unlocks, Steam requires your profile and **Game details** to be public;
connecting a Steam account is the optional alternative, and covers Steam Family too - see
[Connected accounts](sources.md#connected-accounts).

**Which platforms does it run on?**
Windows 10 and Windows 11 only. Packaged releases include their own runtime; Node.js is needed only
to build from source.

**Do I have to connect any account?**
No. Steam, Epic and Xbox PC can each be connected *optionally*, to read what the local files do not
carry; every token is encrypted before it is stored on this PC. Everything else works without an
account.

**Does it work offline?**
Yes, for local sources and anything already cached. Achievement names, descriptions and artwork are
fetched online the first time and then reused from
`%APPDATA%\Achievement Watcher Next\steam_cache`.

**Simple or Advanced - do I lose anything by choosing Simple?**
No. Simple hides controls, it never turns a feature off. No parser, watcher, scan or stored value
changes with it, and switching back restores every control with the value it already had. See
[Getting started](getting-started.md#simple-and-advanced).

## The library

**A game is missing.**
Check that its source is enabled in **Settings → Sources**, run **Smart Find** under
**Settings → Folders**, and turn off **Installed games only** to see whether it is known but no
longer considered installed. Full checklist:
[Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#a-game-is-missing).

**A game shows "No achievements".**
That game has no achievement set at all. It stays launchable and keeps tracking playtime, and it is
left out of completion statistics rather than dragging the average down as a 0%.

**A game shows 0% even though I have unlocked achievements.**
There is a schema but no runtime unlock file. Open the game's
**[Game Health](game-health.md)** panel - it names the missing piece and offers only the repairs that
apply.

**Why does the same game appear twice?**
It was found through two sources. **Merge Duplicates** in Settings → General combines them; if one
entry is a stale save folder for a game you now own elsewhere, blacklist it.

**A game update added achievements and I do not see them.**
A cached list re-checks itself every 3 days. To pick them up now, use **Settings → Advanced →
Recheck achievement lists**. Nothing already cached is removed by that check.

## Notifications

**Nothing appears when I unlock something.**
Start with the Notifications row of that game's [Game Health](game-health.md) panel: it names the
transport that last delivered and why. Then work through
[If a test or unlock does not appear](notifications.md#if-a-test-or-unlock-does-not-appear).

**The overlay popup does not show in one particular game.**
That game is very likely in exclusive fullscreen, where an always-on-top popup is not drawn at all.
On **Automatic** this is handled for you: that unlock arrives as a Windows notification instead. See
[how Automatic decides](notifications.md#how-automatic-decides).

**Notifications are hidden while I play.**
That is Windows' Do Not Disturb. Turn on **Priority notifications** and approve Windows' one-time
request - see [Priority Windows notifications](notifications.md#priority-windows-notifications).

**Can I change how the popup looks, or share a design?**
Yes - nine presets ship with the app, the **Preset Designer** builds your own with ordinary controls,
and any preset exports to a single `.awpreset` file. See
[Presets and the Preset Designer](presets.md).

**Is the in-game overlay the same thing as the popup?**
No. The popup is a one-shot notification styled by a preset. The **overlay** is the full achievement
list you open with `Ctrl+Shift+K` while a game runs - see the [Overlay guide](overlay.md).

## Safety and data

**Does AW Next modify my games?**
Only when you ask it to. Reading achievements is read-only. The emulator repair tools - in a game's
right-click **Emulator & tools** submenu and under **Settings → Emulators** - do write to a game
folder, always after a confirmation and always with a backup.
Use them only with games you own.

**My antivirus flagged a file, or removed one.**
Almost certainly the Steam emulator or a Ubisoft loader, and it is a false positive. Those files
stand in for a game's Steam or Ubisoft library, which is exactly the behaviour detection engines look
for, so they are flagged on what they do rather than on anything they contain. The alert fires the
moment a file is written - a repair you ran, opening **Settings → Emulators**, or automatic repair
during a scan - and Windows Defender takes every copy at once, including the ones installed with the
app. Nothing is written unless you asked for one of those. Allow the file your antivirus named, or
exclude `%APPDATA%\Achievement Watcher Next\cache`; never switch protection off. See
[Troubleshooting → Antivirus](troubleshooting.md#antivirus-or-smartscreen-warning).

**Windows SmartScreen warns about the installer.**
Releases are signed with the project's own self-signed certificate rather than a commercial one, so
SmartScreen may still ask for confirmation. You never need to install that certificate. Download only
from the [official releases page](https://github.com/Shirowwww/Achievement-Watcher-Next/releases) and
check the installer against the SHA-512 value in the matching `latest.yml`.

An installer can be checked against VirusTotal by its own SHA-256 without trusting anyone: run
`Get-FileHash <installer> -Algorithm SHA256` and open `https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/<hash>`.
The current release is [3.10.4](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/98737bd01f34be8aa8d86da8c9de5d52a62b070c091c6611366b174421932f99).
See [Troubleshooting -> Checking a release yourself](troubleshooting.md#checking-a-release-yourself).

**Where is my data, and does updating lose it?**
Everything lives in `%APPDATA%\Achievement Watcher Next`, and installing a newer build over an older
one preserves it. The first launch after upgrading imports an older Achievement Watcher folder
without ever modifying or deleting it - see
[Updates and existing data](getting-started.md#updates-and-existing-data).

**How do I quit completely?**
Closing the window keeps AW Next in the system tray so tracking continues. Use the tray menu to exit
fully.

## The project

**How does this differ from Achievement Watcher 2.x?**
AW Next is a continuation with a modern runtime and a large compatibility, reliability and feature
pass. Side-by-side table: [Comparison](comparison.md).

**Can it get me games, keys or accounts?**
No, and the issue tracker cannot help with that either. AW Next contains no game files and does not
bypass online ownership checks.

**I found a bug / I have an idea.**
[Open an issue](https://github.com/Shirowwww/Achievement-Watcher-Next/issues) with the app version,
your Windows version, the source involved and the relevant logs. For a suspected vulnerability, use
the private process in the [security policy](https://github.com/Shirowwww/Achievement-Watcher-Next/blob/main/SECURITY.md) instead.
