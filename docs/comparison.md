# How AW Next compares

AW Next continues [Xan105's original Achievement Watcher](https://github.com/xan105/Achievement-Watcher)
and [darktakayanagi's 2.x branch](https://github.com/darktakayanagi/Achievement-Watcher). This page
places it beside that lineage and beside
[Achievements](https://github.com/PSerban93/Achievements), the other actively developed tracker, so
you can tell which one fits how you play.

## In short

**AW Next** focuses on an all-in-one library, a quiet tray workflow, notifications that pick their
own transport, and deeper Goldberg / GBE repair with a per-game health report behind it.

**Achievements** has a strong auto-configuration and animated-overlay workflow.

**Achievement Watcher 2.x** remains the historical base, with broad emulator compatibility and
several legacy notification transports.
