  Simple / Advanced - how much of AW Next the interface shows.

  This is a DISPLAY setting and nothing else. Every parser, the watchdog, the scan and the unlock
  pipeline behave identically in both modes; the only thing that changes is which controls and which
  wording the user is shown. Nothing is disabled by choosing Simple, and every capability stays one
  switch away.

  Kept pure (no DOM, no fs, no Electron, no i18n) so the whole policy - which tabs, which rows, which
  Game Health checks - is one testable list instead of conditions scattered across the renderer.
  app/ui/settings.js does the class toggling with these selectors; app/app.js reads the check policy.
