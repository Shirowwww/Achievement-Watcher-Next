  `latest.yml` has to be fetched to answer "am I up to date?" at all - it is the manifest that

  guaranteed is what happens afterwards: a manifest naming the version already installed, or an
  older one (a rolled-back release, a stale CDN copy, a local build ahead of the published tag),
  must never turn into a prompt or a download. electron-updater applies its own semver gate before
  emitting update-available; this is the app's own check, so a surprise there cannot cost the user a
  pointless installer download or a dialog offering them what they are already running.

  An unparseable version on either side returns false: that is electron-updater's call to make, and

  Whether a finished download has to wait before installing itself.

  quitAndInstall() closes AW, runs the NSIS upgrade and relaunches it, which puts installer windows
  on screen. Doing that underneath a running game is rude, so an update that arrived on its own
  waits for the session to end and `setGameActivity` offers it again.

  An update the user asked for is a different thing. They opened Settings, clicked "Check for
  updates", then clicked "Download && Install" - three deliberate actions - and nothing after that
  point should quietly decide they did not mean it. That distinction is not hypothetical: a
  permanently resident Steam app (a controller utility, an overlay tool, a launcher companion) is a
  running game by every signal AW has, for as long as the machine is switched on. Without this
  exception such a machine downloads every update and installs none of them, and because the
  hold-back only retries when the last game exits, an event that never comes, nothing ever tells the
  user why the app keeps offering the same version.
