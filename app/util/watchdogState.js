  a child process over IPC and separately probes its named pipe, but neither proves it's doing
  anything: a wedged event loop keeps both open while tracking nothing. The monitor therefore pings
  over IPC on a timer (watchdog/watchdog.js), which only a turning event loop can do, and this
  reduces those observations to one state. Kept free of Electron and process handles so it can be
  exercised directly.
