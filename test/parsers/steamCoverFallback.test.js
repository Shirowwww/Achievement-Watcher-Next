/*
  Library covers.

  Three users reported tiles that stayed blank for games SteamGridDB clearly has artwork for. The
  cause was not the lookup but WHERE it lived: the SteamDB -> SteamGridDB chain ran only inside
  getSteamDataFromSRV, which is the cache-MISS path. Once a schema was cached - with `portrait:
  null`, because product info happened to have no capsule that one time - every later scan went
  through GetMissingData, which re-asked product info and stopped there. The tile could never
  recover, on any number of rescans.

  These tests pin the chain itself and the fact that the repair path is wired to it.
