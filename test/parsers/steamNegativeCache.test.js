  The negative cache stops a non-existent appid from costing a full 11-30s Steam lookup on every
  scan. Its danger is that "no data came back" and "this is not a Steam app" are indistinguishable at
  the call site - and offline they are the same thing for EVERY appid, so a single offline scan could
  blacklist the whole library for the cache's lifetime. The rule below is what prevents that.
