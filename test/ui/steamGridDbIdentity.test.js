  SteamGridDB lookups.

  "Staffer Retro : A Supernatural Mystery Quest" had a permanently blank tile because SteamGridDB
  files it under the shorter name "Staffer Retro", and the title matcher is deliberately strict -
  loosening it to a prefix rule would equally match "LEGO Batman" to "LEGO Batman: Legacy of the
  Dark Knight", and the in-code policy is that a wrong cover is worse than none.

  The way out is to stop matching titles when there is no need to: /games/steam/<appid> is an
  identity mapping. These tests pin that the identity path is preferred AND that the title matcher
  kept every bit of its strictness for the sources that have no Steam appid (Ubisoft, GOG, Epic).
