> **AW Next** is the next generation of Achievement Watcher. It continues
> [Xan105's original](https://github.com/xan105/Achievement-Watcher) and
> [darktakayanagi's 2.x branch](https://github.com/darktakayanagi/Achievement-Watcher) with a modern
> runtime and a large compatibility, reliability and feature pass.

## What it does

- **One library for every source.** Launcher data, Steam-compatible saves and console emulators in a
  single list, with search, filters, rarity tiers, progress achievements and covers.
- **Notifications that choose their own transport.** Leave delivery on **Automatic** and each unlock
  arrives through the in-game overlay when it can be seen, and as a Windows notification when it
  cannot - never both.
- **A popup you can actually design.** Nine bundled presets, a no-code **Preset Designer** that
  previews the real popup, and one-file `.awpreset` sharing.
- **An in-game overlay list.** The running game's full achievement list on `Ctrl+Shift+K`, with
  search, filters and rarity badges - drivable entirely from a gamepad.
- **Answers when something is wrong.** Each game has a **Game Health** panel that says whether it is
  tracked, why not, and offers only the repairs that genuinely apply.
- **Repair tools for local setups.** Read-only diagnosis, `steam_settings` repair, matched GBE Fork
  runtime install, architecture-safe automatic Uplay R2 repair, transactional backups and restore.
- **Yours to shape.** Simple and Advanced interface modes, built-in themes plus a custom one, full
  controller navigation, and 28 bundled interface languages.
- **Local-first.** No Steam Web API key, no required account, its own data directory, and caches that
  keep the library working offline.

## Install

1. Download `Achievement.Watcher.Setup.<version>.exe` from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/Shirowwww/Achievement-Watcher-Next/releases/latest).
2. Install and open AW Next, then follow the first-run guide.
3. Run **Settings → Folders → Smart Find**, and add any custom game or save location.
4. Leave the app in the system tray for live notifications and playtime tracking.

Settings, caches, playtime and achievement data live in `%APPDATA%\Achievement Watcher Next`.
Upgrading preserves them, and the first launch after an upgrade imports an older Achievement Watcher
folder without ever modifying it.

> confirmation and always with a backup. Use them only with games you own.

## Build from source

Requires Windows and Node.js `22.22.2+` or `24.15+`. The app and the background Watchdog are separate
npm workspaces; `npm run build` writes the installer and updater files to `app\dist`. See
[BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for setup, packaging details and known constraints.

## Security and support

Found a problem, have an idea, or simply want something improved?
[Open an issue](https://github.com/Shirowwww/Achievement-Watcher-Next/issues) - reports and
suggestions are what help AW Next get better. For a vulnerability, use the private process in the
[security policy](SECURITY.md) rather than a public issue.

Download builds only from the
[official releases page](https://github.com/Shirowwww/Achievement-Watcher-Next/releases); `latest.yml`
carries the installer's SHA-512 digest. Installers use the project's self-signed `CN=Shirow`
certificate, which you do not need to install or trust - SmartScreen or antivirus warnings remain
possible because it is not issued by a publicly trusted authority. Sensitive settings and
connected-account tokens are encrypted before local storage, and the project contains no game files
and does not bypass online ownership checks.

For a bug report, include the app version, Windows version, affected source and the relevant files
from `%APPDATA%\Achievement Watcher Next\logs`. The issue tracker cannot provide games, credentials
or piracy support.
